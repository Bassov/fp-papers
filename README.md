# What you can find in this repo

I started reading some papers about functional programing and
i though it would be a good idea to implement things given in paper. Either for solving some tasks or for learning.
Also there could be a code from talks, or some articles.

In each file you will find code where it is said which paper is taken to write that code, additionally there could be references to study topic further. And there should be an implementation, maybe with examples.
